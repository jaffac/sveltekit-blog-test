## Introduction

There is a specific kind of magic that happens when a musician stops trying to be perfect and starts trying to be _warm_.

If you’ve spent any time on this blog, you know my affinity for **orange**—not just as a color, but as a feeling. It’s the hue of a sun-drenched afternoon, the glow of a vacuum tube, and the saturated hum of a vintage record. It seems **Andy Baxter**, the architect behind the London-based project **Robohands**, has finally caught up to that same frequency.
<br/>

With his latest LP, **_Oranj_** (released 16. January 2026), Baxter has completed his chromatic journey, moving from the mossy underground of **_Green_** (2018) into the rich, amber light of his most defiant record yet.

**The Analog Island** 🏝️

In an era of digital perfection, Baxter uses "Islands of Analog." While the distribution is modern, the core is a 1970s Otari MX5050 reel-to-reel tape machine. By recording to 2-inch tape, he ensures that the "Ghost in the Machine" isn't a digital error—it’s the soul of the record.

## Color as Temperature

In the world of Robohands, "Orange" isn't just a stylistic spelling; it’s a temperature. Recorded between the jazz hubs of Chicago and London, the album is a 14-track love letter to the inventors of analog gear.

We’re talking about the thud of a 1960s Fender Jazz bass and the "chime" of a vintage Hammond organ spinning through a Leslie cabinet.

Tracks like **"Hermit Part III"** and **"Marea"** don't just play; they breathe. They carry that hazy, sunlit quality we often look for—a sound that is soft at the edges but possesses a "chilly morning crispness" in its guitar lines.

## The Humanizing of the Machine

The name "Robohands" has always been a clever irony. It suggests a precision-engineered machine, yet **_Oranj_** is deeply, almost stubbornly, human.

By favoring valve-driven outboard gear over clean digital plugins, Baxter captures the imperfections that make music feel alive. Whether it’s the frenetic energy of **"Achilles"** or the Boards of Canada-esque nostalgia of **"1989,"** the music refuses to stay on a digital grid.

While Baxter plays the majority of the instruments himself, the addition of long-time collaborator **Francesca Uberti** on the Rhodes piano adds a layer of conversational intimacy. It reminds us that even "Robohands" need a human touch to find the groove.

## Conclusion: Saturated Frequencies

If _Green_ was the beginning of the journey, _Oranj_ is the moment you stop walking, sit on the porch, and watch the sky turn that impossible, saturated hue of 2-inch tape.

Whether you’re listening for the Robert Glasper-esque modern jazz fusion or the psychedelic ambient textures, this album feels like a culmination. It is a bridge between two cities and fifty years of recording history.
